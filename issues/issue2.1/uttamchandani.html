<p>Title: Educational Intimacy</p>

<p>by Suraj Uttamchandani.</p>
<p>Comic image: Suraj, a Brown man with rectangle glasses.</p>
<p>Text: “Context: LGBTQ youth activists”</p>
<p>Comic image: Four queer youth sit in chairs around a table. From left to right: A person with curly hair raises a finger in the air. Speech bubble shows a lightbulb. A person in a button-down shirt and side-parted hair has a speech bubble with a thumbs-up. A person in a hoodie points at a sheet of paper on the table. Speech bubble shows an exclamation point. A person holding a tablet computer with hand raised. Speech bubble shows “100” emoji.</p>

<p><b>Page 2</b></p>

<p>Panel 1: Text: “Chroma is a youth-led organization in the Midwest US for LGBTQ+ and allied youth.*” Comic image: Four queer youth stand with hands on hips. Text: “* ‘LGBTQ+’ youth here means ‘lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, intersex, asexual, and other sexual and gender minority people between 12 and 20 years old.’”</p>
<p>Panel 2: Two queer youth speak to the reader. First speech bubble: “We have lots of discussions about what it means to be ‘youth-led’ and that looks different at different times.” Second speech bubble: “For us, it means that in decision-making about Chroma activities, we prioritize the perspectives of the youth President, Vice-President, and leadership team.”</p>
<p>Panel 3: Text: “Chroma meets weekly to do various activities, from playing games together to discussions about LGBTQ+ social issues.” Comic image: a board game, a deck of cards, and a set of speech bubbles including two interlocking rings (referring to marriage equality), ACT UP, the pride flag and trans flag, and gendered bathroom signs.</p>
<p>Panel 4: Text: “Chroma also has a Teaching Committee, a group of youth who teach teachers and other community members how to best support LGBTQ+ youth.” Comic image: Two youth at the front of a room point to a large screen with “Yes” and “No” as headers with two columns of text under. An audience of adults watches their presentation. Text: “For example, Chroma youth gave professional development presentations to every teacher in their school district.”</p>
<p>Panel 5: Comic image of Suraj standing with one hand on his hip and the other hand raised. Speech bubble: “I joined Chroma as an adult volunteer to support the teaching committee.” Second speech bubble: “I joined each committee meeting, helped youth hone their presentations, and often drove them to trainings.” Other images show youth sitting at table, youth in a car driving, and youth leading a workshop with Suraj taking notes on the side.</p>

<p><b>Page 3</b></p>

<p>Text: “Educational Intimacy is the kind of inclusive intimacy that develops among people as they support each other in working towards a shared vision. You can tell educational intimacy is there through humor…”</p>
<p>Comic image: Four youth talk with each other. Youth 1 walks toward the right, looking upward and with a finger at their lip in contemplation. Speech bubble: “Maybe we can just say that teachers’ goal should be to make a space for the most marginalized people.” Youth 2 is stopped in their tracks with hands on head (facepalm). Speech bubble: “That’s too logical, we’re fools for not saying that all along!” Youths 3 and 4 walk toward the right. Youth 3 speech bubble: “To be fair, if it’s TOO logical, the audience won’t get it.” Youth 4 speech bubble: “HA!”</p>
<p>Text: “…little moments of self-deprecation, teasing, and exaggeration…”</p>
<p>Comic image: Three youth faces, shown from shoulders up. Youth 1 speech bubble: “ROAST ME!” Disembodied response speech bubble: “Ha!” Youth 2 speech bubble: “Drag them!”</p>
<p>Disembodied response speech bubble: “LOL.” Youth 3 speech bubble: “I’m a fool!” Disembodied response speech bubble: “Heh heh.”</p>

<p><b>Page 4</b></p>

<p>Text: “…empathetic decision-making…”</p>
<p>Comic image: Two youth converse, shown from the waist up.</p>
<p>Youth 1 speech bubble: “For the event on coming out, should we ask people how they came to their identity, or choose more specific questions?”</p>
<p>Youth 2 speech bubble: “Maybe specific questions is better, because if you asked me something broader I’d be like, uhhhhhhh….”</p>
<p>Youth 1 speech bubble: “That’s fair.”</p>
<p>Text: “…and thoughtfully holding one another accountable.”</p>
<p>Comic image: Two youth sit at a table. Youth 1 writes on flip chart paper. Youth 2 works on a tablet. Youth 1 speech bubble: “So then she was like—”</p>
<p>Youth 2 speech bubble: “I think they use ‘they.’”</p>
<p>Youth 1 speech bubble: “Right! So then they said…”</p>
            
<p><b>Page 5</b></p>

<p>Comic image: Suraj’s face appears in an oval. Text: “It’s what emerges when we pay attention to one another’s insights and feelings while getting things done.”</p>
<p>Four offset images in boxes representing a sequence:
<p>Image 1: Three youth talk at a table. The two at the sides speak boisterously, with overlapping speech bubbles containing exclamation points, while person in the middle raises their hand and grimaces.
<p>Image 2: The same three youth at the table. The center person holds arms wide. Speech bubble: “Shh, can we… can we have quiet for a sec?” The people on both sides say, “sure!”
<p>Image 3: The same three youth. The center person holds up one finger on their right hand. Speech bubble: “When people first get into doing trainings, usually the first time they go to a presentation…”
<p>Image 4: The same three youth. The center person holds up one finger on their left hand. Speech bubble: “…we just have them be on like a Q&A panel, so they can see how everything goes.” Left person speech bubble: “Yeah!” Right person speech bubble: “uh-huh!”
<p>Below the sequence of boxes: Comic image: Suraj’s face appears in an oval. Text: “For queer youth activists, educational intimacy helped us treat each other well now, like we want LGBTQ+ youth to be treated in the future.”</p>
            
<p><b>Page 6</b></p>

<p>Comic image: Suraj’s face appears in an oval. Text: “Educational intimacy matters for learning in collective action spaces: It’s what allowed the Chroma youth to productively create presentations…”</p>
<p>Comic image: A series of disembodied mouths open in speech. Speech bubbles contain symbols: A book, a poo emoji, an easel with a question mark, a thumbs-down emoji, an easel with an X, an easel with a lightbulb, a fire emoji, a star-eyes emoji.</p>
<p>Text: “…and to generatively critique one another…”</p>
<p>Comic image of three sets of disembodied speech bubbles in dialogue.</p>
<p>Set 1: Speech bubble from left: “So Ms. Clark was there, too.” Speech bubble from right: “Oh.” Speech bubble from left: “She was on the sidelines, but I waved.”</p>
<p>Set 2: Speech bubble from right: “Did you, like, comically stage whisper— ‘don’t say “transgendered.”’” Outside of speech bubbles: “ha ha.” Speech bubble from left: “I did not do that.”</p>
<p>Set 3: Speech bubble from right: “You shoulda told Jaime to do it.” Speech bubble from right: “Yeah, I would’ve done it!”</p>
<p>Text: “…to envision the kind of inclusion their schools could offer… to make their advocacy as effective as possible.”</p>
<p>Comic image: Four youth give a presentation to two seated adults. One adult, an older white man with a giant mustache, has his arms crossed. The other, a black woman with cool glasses, takes notes. Text on a pull-down screen behind the youth says, “How to be LESS terrible!”</p>
