          <h3>Special Forum: "Environmental Humanities, Ecological Literacy"</h3>
              <p>Over the last decade, humanists have begun to ask, “what can <i>we</i> do?” in the midst of global environmental crises. Framed within humanist inquiry, this question has driven expansive new research endeavors under the umbrella of the Environmental Humanities, including research in ecological literacy, ecocriticism, ecocomposition, blue humanities and blue ecocriticism, to name but a few. Likewise, studies in climate fiction, maritime literature, nature writing, ocean studies, water studies, environment and social justice, environmental activism, and others have become central to the work in critical theory now emerging in the humanities. Like other kinds of work in critical theory, environmental humanities inquiries have also adopted degrees of advocacy and activism, embracing “what can we <i>DO</i>?” as implying a kind of active doing. As such, the Environmental Humanities has grown to encompass a diverse and dynamic range of areas of study.</p>
              <p>Within this umbrella, <i>Sequentials</i> seeks comics that take up Environmental Humanities and Ecological Literacy broadly defined. We are particularly interested in submissions that contribute to current conversations in or about the subjects listed below. Submissions must be illustrated in comics form.</p>
              <p>Possible topics may include, but are not limited to:</p>
              <li>Environmental Humanities, broadly defined</li>
              <li>Ecological/Environmental literacy, broadly defined</li>
              <li>Ecological/Environmental literacy and the politics of literacy</li>
              <li>Ecocriticism</li>
              <li>Ecofeminism</li>
              <li>Climate Fiction</li>
              <li>Environment and Social Justice</li>
              <li>Blue Humanities/Blue ecocriticism</li>
              <p>By “comics,” we loosely mean illustrated, sequential images that may or may not incorporate words and may or may not be bounded within panels or other boundary markers. We invite submissions from individuals in all academic disciplines, regardless of their level of experience with comics or illustration “skills.” Further, submissions will be welcomed from non-academics, as well, and the editorial team at <i>Sequentials</i> will consider all submissions equally. Submissions may be of any length and may be either a large, single image or a series of “pages” to be displayed sequentially. All submissions will be blind reviewed by the <i>Sequentials</i> editorial team.</p>
              <p>We strongly encourage contributors to consider how the comics form can interpret, envision, or reflect meanings associated with the given topic. To submit, please upload a submission title, cover letter, and high-resolution image(s) to the “Sequentials 2.2 - Environmental Humanities, Ecological Literacy” category of the Submittable platform (<a href="https://trace.submittable.com/submit">https://trace.submittable.com/submit</a>) by <b>July 31, 2021</b>.
